Disable USB usage
Depending on how critical your system is, sometimes it’s necessary to disable the USB sticks usage on the Linux host. There are multiple ways to deny the usage of USB storage; here’s a popular one:

Open the “blacklist.conf” file using your favorite text editor:

#nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
When the file opens, then add the following line at the end of the file (save and close):

blacklist usb_storage
After this, open the rc.local file:

#nano /etc/rc.local
Finally, add the following two lines:

modprobe -r usb_storage
exit 0
